    "description": "The SOC2 framework maps AWS service configurations to SOC2 Trust Service Criteria (TSC) requirements. SOC2 is a framework developed by the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) that specifies how organizations should manage customer data based on five 'trust service criteria': security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. For detailed implementation guidance, refer to the SOC2_Implementation_Guide.md file in the frameworks/SOC2 directory. For remediation steps to address findings, refer to the SOC2_Remediation_Guide.md file.",
